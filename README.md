## Instructions:

1. Save the script as convert_to_exe.bat.

2. Open a Command Prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved convert_to_exe.bat.

3. Run the script with the path to your .bat file as an argument: ``` convert_to_exe.bat yourfile.bat.' ```


This script uses the IExpress tool to package the .bat file into a self-extracting .exe file. It creates a temporary IExpress directive file (SED file) to define the package settings, runs IExpress to generate the .exe, and then cleans up the temporary file. Note that the resulting .exe will simply run the original batch script.
